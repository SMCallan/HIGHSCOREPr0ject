# HIGHSCOREPr0ject


Below is a revised version of the proposal that elaborates on each section to ensure alignment with the assessment rubric and real-world applicability:

---

**Subject:** Proposal for Implementing a Self-Learning AI in the High Score Project

---

**Introduction:**
The High Score Project endeavors to build an engaging and competitive platform enabling users to indulge in a classic game of Tic Tac Toe. The proposed system will incorporate user registration, score tracking, and a global leaderboard to foster a competitive environment. A unique feature of this project is the integration of a self-learning AI opponent using Reinforcement Learning (RL), which stands as a testament to the real-world applicability and the innovative spirit of this project.

**Objective:**
1. **User-Friendly Platform:** Create an intuitive interface for users to register, login, and engage in games of Tic Tac Toe against other users or the AI opponent.
2. **Competitive AI Opponent:** Develop a self-learning AI using RL that evolves with each game, providing a challenging opponent for users.
3. **Grading Criteria Alignment:** Ensure meticulous adherence to the grading rubric outlined in the Enterprise Software Engineering assignment guidelines.
4. **Real-World Application:** Explore the potential of transitioning this academic project into a real-world application, laying the groundwork for live deployment and scaling.

**Timeline:**
- **Week 1-2 (Core Project Implementation):**
    - **System Specification and Design:** Define clear system specifications aligning with one of the outlined scenarios, and create detailed UML diagrams to visualize the system architecture, ensuring alignment with the grading criteria on Complexity of Database and Implementation Consistency with Design.
    - **Spring Boot Application Setup:** Establish the Spring Boot application structure, configure database connectivity, and develop a RESTful API catering to user registration, score submission, and leaderboard retrieval, aligning with the grading rubric on Spring Boot Application.
    - **Initial Testing:** Conduct basic testing to ensure functionality and consistency with the design, covering the Testing criterion in the grading rubric.

*Cut-off point for covering all grading criteria.*

- **Week 3 (Basic AI Implementation):**
    - **Algorithmic AI Opponent:** Implement a basic algorithmic AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm, integrating it within the existing system to provide an immediate interactive experience for users.
    - **Design Pattern Integration:** Incorporate necessary design patterns like Singleton, Factory, and Strategy, ensuring alignment with the Design Patterns Used criterion in the grading rubric.

- **Week 4 (Reinforcement Learning AI Implementation):**
    - **RL Model Design and Training:** Design a simplistic RL model, train it using historical or simulated game data, and integrate this self-learning AI into the system.
    - **Evaluation and Refinement:** Conduct thorough testing, evaluation, and necessary refinements to ensure the AI operates as intended, and document the process and results for the Critical Evaluation criterion in the grading rubric.

**Future Scope (Post-Assignment Submission):**
- **Enhanced RL Model:** Explore more advanced RL algorithms to enhance the AI's competitiveness.
- **Live Deployment:** Prepare the project for live deployment on a domain, optimizing for scalability and real-world usability.
- **Platform Expansion:** Consider expanding the platform to incorporate other classic games and AI opponents, transforming it into a comprehensive gaming platform.

**Budget and Resources:**
- Access to machine learning environments for RL model development and training.
- Cloud computing resources for potential live deployment and scalability testing.
- Relevant software development tools and libraries to ensure a smooth development process.

**Conclusion:**
The High Score Project presents an exciting amalgamation of software engineering principles, innovative AI integration, and real-world applicability. The planned adherence to the grading rubric, coupled with the ambitious goal of transitioning this project into a real-world application, underlines the academic and practical potential of this endeavor.

This revised proposal provides a more detailed roadmap and clear alignment with the assessment rubric, along with an emphasis on real-world applicability. Each section is crafted to highlight the meticulous approach towards meeting the academic objectives while also laying the foundation for future real-world deployment and expansion.

Based on the additional details and thoughts, here's a draft for a "Considerations and Additional Thoughts" section for my proposal:

---

### Considerations and Additional Thoughts

**1. Technical Environment:**
   - Utilizing JetBrains' IntelliJ as the primary development environment, leveraging its extensive capabilities for managing databases, executing command-line operations, and integrating various Java libraries essential for our project.
   - As the project progresses towards a live deployment, the utilization of scalable cloud servers and resources will be key to ensuring a smooth transition from an offline, testing phase to an online, real-world application.

**2. Contingency Planning:**
   - In the event that the self-reinforcement AI development faces challenges in the stipulated timeline, a fallback plan to implement a simpler algorithmic AI opponent is in place to ensure the project meets the assessment deadlines without compromising on the core gaming experience.

**3. Offline Testing and Demonstration:**
   - Ensuring the system operates seamlessly in an offline environment for testing and demonstration purposes is a priority. This approach aligns with the assessment requirements and provides a controlled environment for accurate evaluation.

**4. Transition to Online Deployment:**
   - Post-assessment, the ambition is to transition the project to an online platform hosted on a dedicated domain, leveraging cloud services for server hosting to provide a global platform for users to compete and interact.

**5. Continuous Development Post-Assessment:**
   - The journey doesn't end post-assessment. The plan envisions multiple milestones and phases beyond the assessment period to enhance, optimize, and expand the project, driven by feedback, evaluation, and the aspiration for real-world applicability.

**6. Documentation and Reflective Practice:**
   - A commitment to thorough documentation and reflective practice throughout the development journey will not only fulfill the assessment requirements but also provide a rich repository of learnings and insights for future development endeavors.

**7. Cybersecurity and Professionalism:**
   - Operating with a high level of cybersecurity awareness and professionalism is paramount, especially as the project transitions from an academic exercise to a real-world application with actual users.

**8. Tutor Engagement and Feedback Loops:**
   - Establishing regular engagement and feedback loops with the tutor will ensure the project remains on track with the assessment requirements and benefits from expert guidance throughout its development journey.

**9. Risk Assessment and Mitigation:**
   - A detailed risk assessment covering technical, time, and resource risks, along with defined mitigation strategies, will be integral to navigating challenges and ensuring the project's success.

**10. Exploratory Research for AI Development:**
    - Continued research and exploration into effective techniques for developing a self-learning AI will be crucial. This endeavor will not only enrich the project but also contribute to the academic and practical understanding of AI in gaming applications.

**11. Performance Metrics and Evaluation:**
    - Defining clear performance metrics for both the system and the AI, and conducting rigorous evaluations will provide objective measures of success and areas for improvement.
